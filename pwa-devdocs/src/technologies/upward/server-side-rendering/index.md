## What is Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server side rendering (SSR) is a method of providing pre-generated HTML in response to an HTTP request.

For example, the contents of this website is pre-built from source files.
These files are converted into HTML pages and uploaded into an HTTP hosting server.
When a user visits the site, the server returns the pre-built HTML file for the browser to render.
